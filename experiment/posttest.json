      "question": "What is the primary purpose of converting a Context-Free Grammar (CFG) to Chomsky Normal Form (CNF)?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To simplify the grammar and facilitate analysis.",
        "b": "To increase expressiveness and flexibility.",
        "c": "To introduce ambiguity in language structure.",
        "d": "To enhance lexical analysis."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Converting CFG to CNF simplifies the grammar for easier analysis. [Learn more](www.examplelink.com).",
        "b": "While CNF simplifies the grammar, it does not aim to increase expressiveness or flexibility.",
        "c": "Converting to CNF aims to reduce ambiguity in language structure.",
        "d": "CNF primarily focuses on structural simplification, not lexical analysis."

      "question": "In the context of Context-Free Grammar (CFG) conversion, what does GNF stand for?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Grammar Normal Form",
        "b": "Greibach Normal Form",
        "c": "Graphical Normal Form",
        "d": "Grouped Nonterminal Form"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. GNF stands for Greibach Normal Form.",
        "b": "Correct! GNF stands for Greibach Normal Form, a specific form of CFG.",
        "c": "Incorrect. GNF does not stand for Graphical Normal Form.",
        "d": "Incorrect. GNF stands for Greibach Normal Form, not Grouped Nonterminal Form."

      "question": "Why might a linguist or a compiler designer choose to convert a CFG to Greibach Normal Form (GNF)?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To enhance human readability of the grammar.",
        "b": "To conform to a specific standard or convention.",
        "c": "To increase ambiguity in language interpretation.",
        "d": "To simplify the grammar for compiler optimization."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "GNF is not primarily chosen for enhancing human readability.",
        "b": "Correct! Converting to GNF may be done to adhere to a specific standard or convention in language representation.",
        "c": "Converting to GNF aims to reduce ambiguity, not increase it.",
        "d": "Simplifying the grammar for compiler optimization is a valid reason for choosing GNF."
