    {
      "question": "What is the primary purpose of converting a Context-Free Grammar (CFG) to Chomsky Normal Form (CNF)?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To simplify the grammar for easier parsing and analysis.",
        "b": "To increase expressiveness and flexibility of the language.",
        "c": "To introduce ambiguity in language structure.",
        "d": "To enhance lexical analysis."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! CNF simplifies CFGs to make parsing algorithms like CYK more efficient.",
        "b": "CNF does not increase expressiveness; it only standardizes grammar form.",
        "c": "CNF aims to reduce ambiguity, not introduce it.",
        "d": "CNF focuses on structural simplification, not lexical analysis."

      "question": "In the context of CFG conversion, what does GNF stand for?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Grammar Normal Form",
        "b": "Greibach Normal Form",
        "c": "Graphical Normal Form",
        "d": "Grouped Nonterminal Form"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. GNF specifically stands for Greibach Normal Form.",
        "b": "Correct! GNF ensures that all production rules start with a terminal followed by zero or more non-terminals.",
        "c": "Incorrect. GNF does not stand for Graphical Normal Form.",
        "d": "Incorrect. GNF does not stand for Grouped Nonterminal Form."

      "question": "True or False: Converting a CFG to CNF changes the language it generates.",
      "answers": {
        "a": "True",
        "b": "False"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. CNF conversion preserves the original language generated by the CFG.",
        "b": "Correct! The language remains the same; only the structure of rules changes."

      "question": "Which of the following statements is TRUE about converting a CFG to Greibach Normal Form (GNF)?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "All production rules must start with a terminal symbol.",
        "b": "Unit productions are not allowed.",
        "c": "It guarantees elimination of left recursion.",
        "d": "All of the above."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! GNF requires rules to begin with a terminal.",
        "b": "True, but alone is incomplete.",
        "c": "True, but alone is incomplete.",
        "d": "Correct! All the above statements are true for GNF conversion."

      "question": "Consider the CFG: S → ASA | aB, B → b. Which step is required to convert it to CNF?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Remove ε-productions",
        "b": "Eliminate unit productions",
        "c": "Break right-hand sides with more than 2 non-terminals",
        "d": "All of the above"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Part of the process, but not sufficient alone.",
        "b": "Unit productions must be removed to comply with CNF.",
        "c": "Right-hand sides longer than 2 non-terminals must be broken down.",
        "d": "Correct! Converting to CNF requires all these steps."

      "question": "Which type of automaton can recognize all context-free languages generated by a CFG?",

        "a": "Finite Automaton",
        "b": "Pushdown Automaton",
        "c": "Turing Machine",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Finite automata cannot recognize all context-free languages.",
        "b": "Correct! Pushdown automata are equivalent in power to CFGs.",
        "c": "Turing machines are more powerful than needed for CFGs.",
        "d": "Linear bounded automata are not specifically tied to CFGs."
